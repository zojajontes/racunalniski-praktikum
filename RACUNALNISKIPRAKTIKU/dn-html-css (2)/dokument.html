    <h2>Visual effects</h2>
    <blockquote> It's never been done before and it's very tricky because our motion capture system, like most motion
        capture systems, is what they call optical base, meaning that it uses markers that are photographed with
        hundreds of cameras. The problem with water is not the underwater part, but the interface between the air and
        the water, which forms a moving mirror. That moving mirror reflects all the dots and markers, and ... it creates
        thousands of false targets, so we've had to figure out how to get around that problem, which we did. ... It's
        taken us about a year and a half now to work out how we're going to do it.
        <p>- Cameron, on blending underwater filming and motion capture system</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p> On July 31, 2017, it was announced that Wētā FX had commenced work on the Avatar sequels. The film heavily
        features underwater scenes, actually filmed underwater with the cast in performance capture. Blending underwater
        filming and performance capture being a feature never accomplished before, it took the team a year and a half to
        develop a new motion capture system. In December 2022, Wētā FX's VFX producer David Conley describe Avatar 2 as
        the biggest visual effects project that the company had ever undertaken, totalling nearly 3.3 billion thread
        powers. To cope with the huge amount of data, Wētā utilized the services of cloud storage company Amazon Web
        Services.
